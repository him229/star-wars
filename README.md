# CSCE 489 Final Project - Star Wars
## File Structure
## Jupyter Notebook
[Location](https://github.com/him229/star-wars/blob/master/index.ipynb)

Note that if the user is attempting to run the notebook, it is in their best interest to skip the data collection phase, since this involves scraping and API calls. Instead, download the file called [all_data_array.json](https://github.com/him229/star-wars/blob/master/all_data_array.json). The notebook can then be run beginning with the cell titled "Data Cleaning".
#### Needed Packages
Ensure that the pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib packages are installed. Use

```$ conda install <package-name>```

or

```$ pip install <package-name>```
