                <p>
                  We aim to analyze popular GitHub repositories and find the
                  common traits and correlations with different parameters among
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Contributions in open source have really moved forward with
                  platforms like Github and bitbucket. This recent trend has
                  allowed for large databases that run software programs to
                  be published openly, and also allows for people from all over
                  the world to contribute to the code base. With Open Source
                  being so prevalent in the technology culture, we decided to
                  analyze some of the most popular Github profiles to find
                  trends that might help provoke what makes these projects
                  so popular, and also find trends in technologies that
                  software engineers are using these days.

                <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                <p>
                  We initially used the API provided by GitHub to get the data. However, the limited rate per hour quickly became problematic for us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to avoid the rate limited problem, we used beautifulsoup to scrape the GitHub repository pages to get the relevant data we needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Web scraping in one machine for large amount of data is not feasible. Hence, we leveraged Google Cloud platform to distribute the loads and used Twillio API to notify us when something happened while the processes were running in the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After that, we had data in many separated files. To ease our analysis effort, we combined them into one single JSON file.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now we have the data, it's time to clean it up. This dataset contains lots of outliers. For example, the Linux repository is one of the most popular and most well-known code bases. However, it has infinitely many contributors and can mess with our analysis. Therefore, we try to single out all the outliers. This cuts the number of repositories almost by half.
                </p>

    <section id="data-Analysis" class="container content-section text-center">

                <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <h3>Legitness</h3>
                  <p>
                    GitHub is supposed to be an open-source code sharing platform. However, we found that lots of popular repositories don't even contain a single line of code. Most of them are tutorials or best practices for certain frameworks or languages. We think these repos are still very valuable but we believe there must be some traits these repos have that the actual code-based repos don't. Therefore, we want to investigate this issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that
                    There are  492  repos that contain code and 41  repos that don't have a single line of code.
                  </p>
                  <div class='white-container'>
                    <img src='./img/legit1.png'></img>
                  </div>
                  <div class='white-container'>
                    <img src='./img/legit2.png'></img>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Based on our analysis, there are lots of differences between repos that contain code (legit repos) and repos that don't (non-legit repos). For instance, legit repos have more than twice as many branches and commits. In addition to those, legit repos have more than 3 times as many open issues and milestones. Non-legit repos have far smaller sizes than legit repos, since most of them only have texts or links to other contents. Nonetheless, on average, non-legit repos do receive slightly more attention than the legit ones as they have more stars/watchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are distinct differences in the repos based on the legitness, so we built a decision tree classifier to help us determine if a repo is legit or not.
                    We used half the dataset as training set and the other half as testing set. Our model was able to
                    predict 243  out of  266  repositories correctly with score = 0.910112359551.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Languages</h3>
                    <p>We are interested in knowing what languages these popular repos use to see if choosing the primary languages for a repo is important to the stars count. First, we will investigate the primary languages of each repository - that is, the language which composes the largest percentage of the code in each repository.</p>
                  <div class='white-container'>
                    <img src='./img/language1.png'></img>
                  </div>
                  <p>Javascript is the most popular primary language used by all the repos in the dataset. 47.6% of repos use mostly Javascript. All of the top 10 languages are fairly well-known and widespread in academia and industry. This is expected, as people would contribute or look at repos written in common languages.
But what are the most unpopular languages used by the popular repos?</p>
                  <p>Most unpopular languages used by popular repos are </p>
                    <p>1.Haskell</br>
                      2.Batchfile</br>
                      3.Crystal</br>
                      4.TeX</br>
                      5.Makefile</br>
                      6.XSLT</br>
                      7.Vue</br>
                      8.Assembly</br>
                      9.Perl</br>
                      10.ApacheConf</br>
                    </p>
                  <p>
                    Unsurprisingly, the pure, lazy and functional language Haskell takes the crown of being the least popular language.
                    What are the top frequently used languages by popular repos?
                  </p>
                  <div class='white-container'>
                    <img src='./img/language2.png'></img>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    We can clearly see that most of those popular repos must have something to do with websites since the web languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript dominate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also seperate the repos by languages.
                    Interestingly, Haskell dominates in several fields such branches_count, commits_count, contributors_count and pull_requests_count. Almost every Haskell repository has a homepage, downloads and a wiki as well as open issues. Perhaps the language is a bit difficult to follow so having extra resources would be helpful to become popular. JavaScript and Java repos get the most stars while C++ and C# receive the least. Golang has the most contributors; it is definitely an up-and-coming language and popular among the open-source community. Java repositories have the largest code base. This is expected as the language itself is extremely verbose.
                  </p>
                  <h3> Miscellaneous</h3>
                  <p>Below are just some miscellaneous fun things we found in this dataset.</p>
                  <p>
                    We noticed that popular repositories that contain code are hard to make commits to because they are already very built out. Some of these popular projects were products that were open sourced by companies, with no active record of commits on GitHub while they were in the beginning stages. Adding code to these projects is difficult because they are more stable versions. This is given by looking at the trend in branches that are created, forks, commit history, and open pull requests.
On analyzing contributor count, we noticed the majority of popular repositories that contained code had less than 100 unique contributors, while a majority of repositories that did not contain code had less than 200 unique contributors. This trend is explained by the fact that contributing to repositories with code is much harder and requires a significant amount of time and effort as compared to repositories with no code.
Milestones are used to track progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository. There are on average 0 milestones for repositories with no code, and less than four milestones for repositories with code. Popular repositories have milestones that need to be met because they have a significant number of concurrent contributions. This is also the case for the number of projects.
A majority of popular repositories that contain code have received less than 10,000 stars on GitHub. However, stars are mostly evenly distributred up to 20,000 stars for repositories with no code. This can be attributed to the lack in the total number of popular repositories with no code.

                    Originally, we wanted to find what makes a repo popular. However, when we collected the data, we mistakenly obtained only the popular repos and ignored the normal repos. Hence, our data were skewed toward the popular ones so we couldn't do any analysis on the difference between these two worlds. Secondly, we realized that collecting data was one of the biggest challenges in data science. Data are very valuable and most places set lots of limitations on how much data we could obtain from them (such as the GitHub rate limit).
